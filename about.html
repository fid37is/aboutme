        I’m Fidelis but you can call me Fidel. <br><br>
        I am from Nigeria and have lived here all my life. For the past years I have been honing my skills in UI/UX designs,
        building products for web and mobile. Also I delve into Frontend Development and Quality Assurance Testing roles.
        <br><br>
        I strive to create elegant solutions that surprise and delight users, while keeping complex technical  dependencies
        in mind for implementation, scalablity and developers’ sanity.
        <br><br>
        I have worked with start-ups as intern on promising projects, also with large development teams with product life 
        cycle spanning couple of years.
        <br><br>
        Depending on the team, resources and deliverables I’ve worn few hats over the years - holding titles like Product 
        Designer, UI Designer, Front-end Developer, Lead Designer and Quality Assurance Tester.
